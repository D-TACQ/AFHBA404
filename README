AFHBA404

#1 Hardware
AHFBA404 is a PCI-express Gen2 4 lane card to fit standard PC enclosure
On the front panel: 4xSFP marked A,B,C,D

AFHBA404 is used to connect 1 to 4 ACQ2106 units to a HOST PC, extablishing a 
fiber-optic link that may be used in one of two ways:

##1.1 HTS High Throughput Stream

Data is transferred in large blocks at maximum 400MB/s per link.
(max 4MB, min 4K), typically to disk archive.

In theory it's possible to run all 4 links at full speed, but to date
D-TACQ has not tested a PC that is capable of handling this.

More typical usage:
1 x 400MB/s, single box, full rate to local disk (NVMe SSD recommended)
4 x 100MB/s, connect 4 x ACQ2106 to single host.

AFHBA404 may also be used to send a common trigger to multiple ACQ2106.

See README.ACQ2106.HTS and STREAM/ for details.

##1.2 LLC Low Latency Control

Classic Plasma Control System.
Data is transferred in "small" blocks, one sample at a time to HOST DRAM
with minimum latency. An LLC system can be implemented in one or multiple
ACQ2106 boxes.

Typical use case:

ACQ2106+4xACQ424ELF-32+2xAO424ELF32 :

128AI, 64AO, run in an LLC loop at 100kSPS.


#2 Device driver

Download from git:

mkdir PROJECTS
cd PROJECTS
git clone https://github.com/D-TACQ/AFHBA404.git
cd AFHBA404

Now refer to INSTALL
make
sudo ./scripts/install-hotplug


[dt100@brotto AFHBA404]$ sudo ./scripts/afhba404-get-ident 
brotto Device d1ac:4104 Device Serial Number af-ba-40-40-11-00-41-0b

af-ba-40-40-11 	: Device ID
00-41		: Serial Number (Decimal!)
0b		: Firmware Revision (hex)

[dt100@brotto AFHBA404]$ sudo ./scripts/get-ident-all 
brotto 0 acq2106_110 A
brotto 1 acq2106_110 B
brotto 2 acq2106_085 A

Lists the attached UUT's.

Linux Device numbers 0,1,2,3 map to local ports A,B,C,D
brotto 0 acq2106_110 A

hostname: brotto 	(the HOST PC)
DEVNUM  : 0      	(localport A)
UUT     : acq2106_110 	(remote host name)
RPORT   : A             (remote port A)

NB: the LINK is used for DATA only. Control is via Gigabit Ethernet

Ideally, the HOSTPC has a DNS system (/etc/hosts if no DNS) that will allow
network software to connect to the UUT by name.
